# Michael Park Portfolio

User Centric Frontend Development Project - Code Institute

This is a static portfolio website whose intended use is for prospective employers to view projects and information relating to myself.  
To accomplish this the portfolio section of the site links to three projects.  
The about section lists my tech skills and work history, as well as having a downloadable version of my cv.
The contact section links to my linkedIn and github. The other social media links and email form have no functionality at this time.
