# Michael Park Portfolio

User Centric Frontend Development Project - Code Institute

This is a static portfolio website whose intended use is for prospective employers to view projects and information relating to myself.  
To accomplish this the portfolio section of the site links to three of my projects.  
The about section lists my tech skills and work history, as well as having a downloadable version of my cv.  
The contact section links to my linkedIn and github. The other social media links and email form have no functionality at this time.  

A live version is hosted [here](https://mparkcode.github.io/portfolio/)

## UX

The design is kept minimalist, primarily with a modern greyscale palette. 
What color exists on the page is used to make it feel iconic, for example the green of the macbook charger and the sepia tones on the polaroid images.  
In keeping with the minimalist design the written segments on the page are kept short and to the point, so as not to overburden the user with too much information. 

User requirements are met in the following ways:  
* The navbar is fully functional and links to the different segments on the page.
* The link for the downloadable cv is fully functional.
* The links on the portfolio segment are functioning.
* Two of the four social media links link to the appropriate place.

### Wireframing

Wireframes were made using the pencil application and can be found in the wireframes folder

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* CSS3 animate it library
    * [This library was used to achive the animated dropdown in the about section](http://jackonthe.net/css3animateit/)

## Features

### Existing Features
* linkable sections on the site from the navbar
* downloadable cv in PDF format
* links to other projects
* links to social media

### Features left to implement
* enable the email form to send mails to my account
* set up a twitter account and link it to the appropriate icon

## Testing
The site was tested on 21" monitors, 15" and 13" laptop screens and on an iPhone SE and iPhone 8 screen to test responsiveness.  
It was also tested using chrome, firefox and safari.  

User testing was done to ensure:
* All links work correctly.
* Links to other sites make use of target="_blank", so as to open the linked site in a new tab.
* The cv downloads correctly.
* The email form gives an error if a required field is not filled in.
* The email input gives an error if an email is entered in an incorrect format.
* The navbar links to the correct section of the site for the link clicked on.
* All hover and visited effects work correctly and as intended

## Deployment
The site is hosted on github pages.  
It is deployed from the master branch.
